# Long Haul Theme for Astro

Long Haul is a minimal, long form theme for Astro. I originally built this theme for Jekyll about 8 years ago(yikes). Somehow, that theme has almost 700 forks and almost 600 stars [on GitHub](https://github.com/brianmaierjr/long-haul) so I figured I'd bring it into the future with Astro ðŸš€.

## Get Started

### Install Dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

### Modify Settings

The main settings can be found inside the `src/data/settings.ts` file. In this file you can edit the site title, description and url. You will also find the navigation menus for the header and footer here.

### Customize Theme

#### Change Primary Color

To change the green primary color you will need to open the `_config.scss` file and change the following variables:

```
--primary-color: #2d8653; // Used for links and buttons
--primary-color-shade: #21633e; // Used for the button hover
--link-hover: #246b43; // Anchor hover color(separate for light and dark theme)
```

#### Change Header Image

After adding your new image to the `public/images` folder, change the path of the **hero** in the `src/data/settings.ts` file to point to your new image.

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
